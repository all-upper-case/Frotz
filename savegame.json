The carpet here is thinner than in your bedroom, worn down by years of bare feet padding to the bathroom at 3 AM. A faint scent of lavender air freshener lingers, though it\u2019s fighting a losing battle against the underlying odor of old takeout and something vaguely musty. To the south, a door stands slightly ajar, revealing a sliver of the bathroom\u2014where the real chaos begins. To the west, the hallway opens into what you *think* is the living room, though it\u2019s hard to tell from here. A narrow console table hugs the wall beneath a flickering fluorescent light, its surface cluttered with unopened mail, a half-dead potted plant, and a landline phone that hasn\u2019t rung in months.\n\nYou can see here: pile of unopened mail, half-dead potted plant, landline phone.\n\nYou can see here: pile of unopened mail, half-dead potted plant, landline phone.",
